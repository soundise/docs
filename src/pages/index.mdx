# Soundise

Soundise is a self-hosted music streaming service.

It allows you to listen to all of your favorite tracks on your home server.
You can even create playlists for parties, workouts, or just for background noise when you're hanging out at home.

Its purpose is to make it easy to set up your own music streaming server, so that you can control where your music is stored and how it's available.
Soundise is built with the goal of having a gorgeous interface and minimal setup time.

This project is targeted at people who want to set up their own servers but don't have the technical knowledge or time to do so.

Soundise is built on top of Rust and React, which means it's open source and free for everyone to use.
